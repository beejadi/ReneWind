# ReneWind
Objective is to predict the generator failure of Wind turbines, thus reducing maintenance cost.
“ReneWind” is a company working on improving the machinery/processes involved in the production of wind energy using machine learning and has collected data of generator failure of wind turbines using sensors. 
They have shared a ciphered version of the data, as the data collected through sensors is confidential (the type of data collected varies with companies). Data has 40 predictors, 40000 observations in the training set and 10000 in the test set.
The objective is to build various classification models, tune them, and find the best one that will help identify failures so that the generator could be repaired before failing/breaking to reduce the maintenance cost.
